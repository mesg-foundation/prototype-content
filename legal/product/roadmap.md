# Roadmap

Interconnexion generale de blockchains et d'Internet.
Blockchain public/ privee / Internet -> Blockchain public/ privee / Internet

## Blockchain -> Internet

#### Multi Blockchain Transaction Real Time Notification
Possiblity to get notified for any blockchain transaction. For now this will be for Ethereum and Bitcoin but should be able to extend this 

#### Multi Blockchain Account Balance Real Time Notification
Connect any action every time the balance of an address change on a specific blockchain

#### Ethereum Contract Event Real Time Notification
Get notified of Ethereum Contract Events outside of the blockchain to trigger whatever action needed



## Payment with our coins
Use our coin to make user use the service. Every time an event is triggered we will get the money from the wallet of the user.


## Internet -> Blockchain

#### Call Contracts from an endpoint
This will be usefull to trigger any contract from a non blockchain application. This can be done "quickly" by just let the user upload is private key but should later be more secure with a specific address created by us for every users like that we can sign the transaction for him

#### Blockchain transaction
Use the same system to this time be able to use this even for transactions and be able to transfer some money automatically throw an endpoint or something similar


## Services marketplace
Let the possibility to the user to extend the list of services they can connect by adding their own services. In the first step this can easily be done with open sourcing this project. When this functionality will be possible directly from inside the application we will be able to create a market place with thoses services and the user who develop it can even monetize it's service. Exemple: A user develop a service to connect to Amazon Alexa and some other users will pay him to access this service


## Contracts marketplace
When many people will use the product we will have a lot of different contracts and many of them could be public and accessible for the public but for now it's quite complicated to find details about some contract. It would be great to have a marketplace where you can search for a contracts based on some criteria and directly use our product features to connect or trigger some events of this contract. As for the services, maybe the user who added this contract can decide to share it or no and even set a price to access it like you buy a Wordpress theme because it has some feature you want, you would buy a contract definition because it match your needs
