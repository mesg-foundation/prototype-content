# Etherstellar

## Introduction

In this document we will present Etherstellar, a echosystem of tools to create and manage all your application related to the Ethereum blockchain.

Blockchain technology is now more than ever a really important and future-proof technology. Before Bitcoin this technology has been used for a single purpose, finance. Ethereum blockchain brings some new advantages and allow people to code "smart contracts" on the blockchain and this opened the door to millions of possibilities.

We saw many projects emerge, from lottery to authenticity network to ensure copyright or proof of authenticity, or even insurance companies or even banks. All thoses projects have one common thing, Ethereum Blockchain.

Today it's already possible to create amazing applications with the blockchain but it's also really complicated and time consuming to create one.

Etherstellar will reduce the complexity and bring all the necessary tools for all the developper to create there applications and all the companies who wants to start using Blockchain technology.

## Services

Our plan is to release different tools for developers and companies that may help them to create easily and quickly there applications.

To do so we had to think about the basics of every applications, what a good applications needs, what a Blockchain brings and what is missing from it and we realised that it was still a lot of tools to create to make Ethereum Blockchain even more amazing. 

For now you can store your data in a way that you can be sure it will be perfectly safe, no possible alteration of your data, no possibility to delete them or "hide" them, everything on the blockchain stays on the blockchain and will not be changed. This is definitely the good point and that is why so many companies are interested about blockchain technologies. But, there is also many things missing. It's actually quite complicated to visualise your different applications on the blockchain (smart contract), visualise the data the contains, interact with thoses data or even know when thoses data or contracts are called. Isn't it normal to know when your user just registered or when you just received a payment in your application.

With all that in mind we decided to create some tools to fix those problems

### Ethereum Blockchain Contract Management

### Ethereum Blockchain Real Time Actions/Notification

### Ethereum Blockchain Transactions

### Ethereum Contract Marketplace
